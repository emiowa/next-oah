							<p className="paragraphStyle">I was in my last year of high school before entering the university, determined but not convinced to study Architecture. It was another day of professional orientation, you know, when professionals go to schools to share their academic and work experiences to give you an idea of what your future could be if you choose to study that career.<br /><br />
							They divided us into groups. I was in the group of design lovers. I have to admit that I felt very out of place. Everyone who was there was clearly recognized for their artistic talents. I was recognized for being more rational, organized and systematic, my notes by hand seemed to be made by computer, always titles in red and handwriting in a perfect Arial 12.<br /><br />
							The orientation began and the speakers asked:<br />
							How many of you consider yourself a creative person? Raise your hand.<br />
							I was the only person who didn’t raise the hand.<br /><br /><br /><br />
							My name is Emi and I’m glad that you have been interested in knowing a little bit about me. I chose to study Architecture at the university, without a doubt the best decision I could ever have made. Architecture awakened in me a strong interest in design that allowed me to start viewing the world in a different way, much more conscious and sensitive.<br /><br />
							The different decisions that I was making in my life took me out of my comfort zone, I quit my job as an Architect and traveled to the other side of the world to start over. Living in a country where I had no friends, job or money, I did what anyone would have done… study. Having a lot of free time but no much money can be a fatal combination or a great opportunity to take advantage of that time as much as possible, and that’s what I did. I understood the only available resource I had in that moment of my life was time, so I decided to invest it in my personal and professional growth.<br /><br />
							I learned programming from the very basics and it was incredible to see how a few lines of code were turned into a website. Once again I was fascinated and realized that what I loved so much about being an Architect was seeing how an idea that one day was written on paper could become a habitable and functional building. Being able to see, touch and feel something that one day was only an imaginary in your head is such a rewarding feeling for me. I experienced that same sensation the first time I created a website. Practically, this is a summary of how I ended up here.<br /><br />
							Yes, OAH Architecture is completely created from scratch by me. Everything you see in this blog was created with effort, work, many months of study, patience and above all a lot of love. It is a very special project for me and I’m grateful that you are here.<br /><br />
							Welcome to OAH Architecture!
