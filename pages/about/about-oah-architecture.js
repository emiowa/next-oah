								<p className="paragraphStyle">I ended up falling in love with Architecture when I understood that it was more than the design of a building, it is about designing a complete experience. Each detail and decision is taken in order to generate something in those who will inhabit the space, it is in our hands to choose if those are going to affect people's lives in a positive way.<br /><br />
								OAH Architecture is an Architecture blog that aims to analyze the social dynamics that arise around an architecture project, conditioned in many cases by the culture and the context in which it is located. When we design a space, we have an imaginary of the activities that can take place in it, nevertheless, the result can be completely different from what we as designers had thought, and it is supposed to be since you don't accessed to a place with an user manual about how you have to inhabit this space.<br /><br />
								Come with me to visit architectural projects around the world to learn about good design and how it can positively affect people's daily lives. Let's build together friendlier and consciously designed spaces.</p>
