								<p className="paragraphStyle">The world is full of impressive architectural projects that, just by looking at photographs of them, are enough to marvel at. However, architecture is much more than a building to be admired; architecture is created to be inhabited.<br /><br />
								I had the opportunity to travel to different countries and visit various architectural projects. It's simply incredible how each of them has its own essence. It is the social and cultural component that makes them so unique. The context in which they are located.<br /><br />
								Welcome to LETâ€™S INHABIT ARCHITECTURE!</p>
