title: 'Circulation'
summary: 'Walking a project should turn into a whole sensorial experience, a way that stimulates each and one of our senses.'
text: 'In many projects we can observe that the circulation is not an important element in the composition and design of a building, very often ignoring the potential that those spaces have for social interaction places. The experience of the users must be enjoyed from the beginning to the end, along the way and destination. Yes, as romantic as it sounds.'
question: 'Could the circulation be the big asset from an architectural project?'
