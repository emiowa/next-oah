title: 'Communal yards'
summary: 'We often ignore the potential from those unused spaces in our neighborhood because of their current aspect.'
text: 'In urban scenarios, where people interaction is to the bare minimum that we do not know our neighbours, spaces to work on social integration are required. The internal yards in the blocks of a neighbourhood could be used for the configuration of a public space network within the area, strengthening the life in community. Spaces could remind you the meaning of vicinity.'
question: 'Are the residual spaces in our neighborhood used to improve social interaction?'
