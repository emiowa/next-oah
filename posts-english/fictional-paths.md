title: 'Fictional paths'
summary: 'Some paths are projected but others are imposed, some are planned and others just appear.'
text: 'Urban design isnâ€™t complete when it is constructed, but when it is inhabited. When people make spaces their own and by the constant inhabit of them, they make decisions that could be convenient and functional for them. The paths that are designed are not always those that are needed; people create fictional paths that turn into recurrent routes as they respond better to their demands and necessities.'
question: 'Are those social dynamics a complement to urban design?'
