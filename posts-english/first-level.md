title: 'First level'
summary: 'The uses that we establish on the first floor of a building can generate interesting social dynamics in the sector.'
text: 'There are many ways in which architecture and urban design can bring a safety and tranquility environment to the streets. Adapting the first level of buildings with public uses like commercial or service will achieve certain activities at different times, both day and night, generating a kind of constant surveillance. This initiative could also help to generate employment by improving the sector economy and offer the community different spaces for leisure, recreation, entertainment, education, among others. Nevertheless, it is highly important to analyze the urban, cultural and social context in order to avoid the negative impact that could have these new uses on the community, since it would bring new social dynamics and new users to the sector.'
question: 'Would the adequation of the first floors for public uses increase security in the sector or on the contrary would it attract unwanted users?'
