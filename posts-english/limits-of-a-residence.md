number: '7'
title: 'Limits of a residence'
summary: 'Home cover all those areas that have an emotional meaning, full of stories and anecdotes to tell.'
text: 'We consider "house" like a refuge, our own place that we can adapt to our preferences, dynamics, and daily activities. Nevertheless, the reality shows us that sometimes we broke with the boundaries that impose a house. Although many times we are restricted to extend our houses, it seems like it does not matter if you extend your home and appropriate external spaces, areas that are for everybody but feel as own as your house.'
question: 'Are those corridors, halls, pavements and sidewalks in front of our houses part of our home?'
