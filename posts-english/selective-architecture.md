title: 'Selective architecture'
summary: 'When architecture is guilty of social exclusion is when we understand how much human-centered are our designs.'
text: 'A numerous community that has turned into a victim of a social exclusion exists, a consequence of architectural and urban designs based on antiquated strategies that might have been functional in the past but are inefficient in the present. These people have to live day by day in cities that are definitely not designed for them.'
question: 'Can the architecture, design, ingenuity, and creativity resolve the accessibility for those people with limited mobility or do we need to provide other strategies?'
