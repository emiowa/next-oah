title: 'Architecture and topography'
summary: 'The architectural project should have a dialogue between the topography and the design.'
text: 'The implantation of an architectural project often requires a land treatment for the stability and safety of the building and the users who will reside in it. Nevertheless, there are cases where the topographic conditions are changed completely with the only objective of adapting the terrain to the building. As designers, we must be creative enough to be able to create a project that can properly implant itself on the site respecting the context and environment. We should not change the characteristics of the place just because there are certain conditions that someone has defined "easier to work with" when an architectural project is being placed.'
question: 'Do you know any architectural projects that could be a good example of sensitive terrain intervention?'
