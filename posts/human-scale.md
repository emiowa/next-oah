title: 'Human scale'
summary: 'Cities are constantly growing, buildings that exceed heights never imagined appear on the scene.'
text: 'With the population growth in the world, cities have been faced with both horizontal and vertical growth in order to respond to the needs and requirements in terms of housing and services that the community demands. Nevertheless, in cities where expansion in the territory is no longer a viable option, they have found great advantages in the design and construction of high-rise buildings since the growth could be given in an established and delimited area. It is a scenario that we could qualify as successful if we look at it as an individual, but the city is much more than that. If several high-rise buildings began to appear on the scene, it could reduce the quality of life of its residents by becoming an aggressive city with the human scale. Urban planning must be of vital importance. The horizontal space gained with the vertical growth of buildings should be used for the design of quality public spaces for the community.'
question: 'Do you consider that your city is being designed in a way that provides quality spaces to the community taking account of the human scale?'
