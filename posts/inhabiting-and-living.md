title: 'Inhabiting and living'
summary: 'Two houses can be the same in terms of spatial distribution or finishes, but they will always be completely different homes.'
text: 'Currently, the vast majority of housing projects offer limited options on their residential typologies, the habitational unit ends up being the replica of another one. Nevertheless, the users are the ones in charge of adapting the space according to their preferences, demands, and needs; transforming it into a completely different unit because their dynamics and ways of inhabiting the space vary from other users. A housing project does not finalize with the construction of it, what happens next is even more interesting. As designers, we can propose a scenario but the users in their daily lives are the ones who decide how they will inhabit the space.'
question: 'Does the architectural design of a residence define the dynamics and activities that will be taken place or are the users who define them?'
