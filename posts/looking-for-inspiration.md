title: 'Looking for inspiration'
summary: 'Knowing and analyzing other architectural projects makes us grow as designers, providing us with knowledge and culture.'
text: 'The technological tools that we currently have, allowed us to know the world from many fields, including architecture. We have marveled at the design of other countries for their creativity, innovation, and style that is generally closely related to their culture. Finding examples in the world of functional, aesthetic, and sustainable architectural projects, have given us the impetus to explore other constructive and structural systems, vary the materials we usually use, or work more in the volume of the building when designing it. Nevertheless, we must be careful because when a project is functional, aesthetic, and sustainable it depends a lot on the environment and context in which it is located, from a social, economic, cultural, and environmental perspective.'
question: 'What are the advantages and disadvantages of looking for architectural projects to find inspiration at the moment we are designing?'
