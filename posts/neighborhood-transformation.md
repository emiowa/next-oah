title: 'Neighborhood transformation'
summary: 'If the parts that define a group are modified, the entire group is transformed. They are not individuals, they are part of something more complex.'
text: 'By intervening in a plot, we are intervening in an entire neighborhood. The appearance of a new project can affect the whole context in which it is found, in a physical and also in a social aspect. There may be a change in the activities that are usually carried out and the users who usually inhabit it, or the conformation of a new program scheme in the sector. A previous study and analysis of the place can make the difference between an architectural project that contributes to the community to one that harms it.'
question: 'Could an architectural project transform the social and cultural dynamics of an entire neighborhood?'
