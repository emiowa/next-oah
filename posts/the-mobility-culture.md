title: 'The mobility culture'
summary: 'Sometimes less is more, sometimes the solution is not found in the space transformation but in the change of the mentality and habits.'
text: 'Frequently people complain about the traffic and the valuable hours they lose staying in front of the steering wheel of a car. Traveling around the city has turned into a stressful and frustrating activity. It is inevitable for many people to attribute this problem to the few built streets or to their sizes, demanding investments for the construction of a road network that can respond properly to the current exigencies, nevertheless, sometimes the "obvious" solution is not the most efficient.'
question: 'Can we find the solution in the construction of a road network or maybe in the change of our current habits towards our transit through the city?'
