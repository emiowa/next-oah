title: 'Vernacular architecture'
summary: 'Understanding the context and conditions of a place helps to design a functional and sustainable project.'
text: 'When we are going to intervene in a place that we do not know, a preliminary study of the scenery and the context is important. Understanding the environmental, social, and cultural conditions of the place will allow to offer the community a project that adequately responds to the needs and requirements in a functional and sustainable way. The most valuable exercise that can be done is the observation of the existing architecture: discover the local materials, know the recurring constructive details in the buildings of the area, or the spatial distribution particularities defined by social and cultural aspects.'
question: 'Should we observe, respect, and replicate the way architecture has been made in a place, or should we as designers propose new alternatives?'
